Authenticaion -

first create a normal authenticaion by register a user and login using registered data
uuid = it provides a unique id 
now we create  a sessionID using uuid  and store this sessionID with the object used for find email, password for login

create a file as auth.js or any other name inside util folder, services as you prefer
in auth.js create a function setId which take two parameters id and user(object) , map this id and user
also create getID function which return id

now we create a cookie res.cookie("cookieName",sessionID);
try login then check cookies in inspectElement -> application -> cookies


when we call "/" home route then authmiddleware called first and check for sessionID 
if cookies has not sessionID then it will redirect to login,
this process repeats untill user doesnot logged in 
if user logged in then session id is assinged with that user and we can route open home page 


cookie-parser is used 
uuid is used for creating sessionID

30:00:00 -> last watched


problem with statefull authenticaion 

 when server reload is occur then user logged out and user have login again;


for maintaining short sessions then use sessions like banking websites 
for maintaining long sessiosns then use tokens
